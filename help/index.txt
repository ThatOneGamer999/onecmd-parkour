Setup:
Obtain a command block through /setblock ~ ~ ~ command_block.

Note: You MUST be in creative mode. Next paste in the command you can get from my Repo.

Possible keybinds to do this: 'CTRL-V' 'COMMAND-V' 'STRG-V'.

Next, place a redstone block on one of the SIDES of the command block. A bootiful machine should appear!

To start the machine: Press the button on the GREEN wool. Now: special blocks! To set someone as "In Parkour Mode": '/scoreboard players set parkour 1'

Use:
Create your parkour.
Place LIME clay at checkpoints and at the beginning.
Make the floor RED clay.
Install my machine.
Step on the LIME clay at the BEGINNING.
Now you're ready to rock and roll!
