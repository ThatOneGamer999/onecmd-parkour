This is a simple guide to using my parkour manager for maps!\r\n\r\nDo check out the [Wiki](https://github.com/ThatOneGamer999/onecmd-parkour/wiki) for more info.\r\n\r\n#Setup:\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nObtain a command block through `/setblock ~ ~ ~ command_block`.\r\n\r\nNote: You MUST be in creative mode.\r\n Next paste in the command you can get from my [Repo](https://github.com/ThatOneGamer999/onecmd-parkour).\r\n\r\nPossible keybinds to do this: `CTRL-V` `STRG-V` `COMMAND-V`.\r\n\r\nNext, place a redstone block on one of the SIDES of the command block. A bootiful machine should appear!\r\n\r\nTo start the machine: Press the button on the GREEN wool.\r\nNow: special blocks! \r\nTo set someone as \"In Parkour Mode\":\r\n'/scoreboard players set <PLAYERNAME> parkour 1'\r\n\r\n***\r\n#Use:\r\n1. Create your parkour.\r\n2. Place LIME clay at checkpoints and at the beginning.\r\n3. Make the floor RED clay.\r\n4. Install my machine.\r\n5. Step on the LIME clay at the BEGINNING.\r\n\r\nNow you're ready to rock and roll!\r\n\r\n***\r\n#Special blocks:\r\n* Checkpoint: LIME stained clay ('minecraft:stained_clay:5')\r\n* Send player back to checkpoint: Grass ('minecraft:grass') or RED stained clay ('minecraft:stained_hardened_clay:14')\r\n\r\nEverything is handled automagically by the machine. \r\n\r\nCheck out the minecraft fourms page [here](http://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/minecraft-discussion/redstone-discussion-and/command-blocks/2612471-parkour-manager-for-maps-in-only-one-command-d#c1).","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
